# KeyWord_Identification


## Description
Keyword identification (or keyphrase extraction) means automatically identifying the most important words or phrases in a text.
When you have tons of documents, articles, or messages, like for example : in research papers, it’s impossible to read everything.
Keyword extraction highlights what each text is about in seconds.
Search engines use keywords to index and rank content.
Keyword identification helps match queries with relevant documents, for example: When you Google “AI image generation,” it finds pages whose extracted keywords match those terms.





This project extracts, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes keywords from websites.
It uses web scraping, text cleaning, frequency analysis, and YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) to identify significant words from webpages.
It also stores the extracted keywords and their frequencies in an SQLite database, allowing comparisons across multiple websites with plots and word clouds.
