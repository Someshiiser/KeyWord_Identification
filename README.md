# KeyWord_Identification

## Description
This project extracts, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes keywords from websites.
It uses web scraping, text cleaning, frequency analysis, and YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) to identify significant words from webpages.

It also stores the extracted keywords and their frequencies in an SQLite database, allowing comparisons across multiple websites with plots and word clouds.
